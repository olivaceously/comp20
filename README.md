Final Lab: Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio

Olivia MacDougal

27 April 2016

Purpose of This Repo:
	The repository represents my portfolio from this class - all of my important homework and lab assignments in one convenient place! Not only can I show this to future employers, I can use it for reference during future web-related endeavors.

Favorite Assignment:
	Both my favorite and least favorite assignment was Assignment 3. While writing assignment 3, I was frustated, confused and resented how hard/complicated it was. Now I realize how impressive and cool the assignment actually was looking back. I enjoyed the first couple of assignments and labs, but they felt too easy - like anyone with a browser and access to Google could do them. Assignment 3 was challenging - I felt like I really had to problem solve and think through how to get the database and servers to work exactly as I wanted.

How Much I've Grown:
	Coming into this class, I had gone through the Codeacademy HTML and CSS courses and thought I had a general understanding of how the web works. On Day 1, I realized I really didn't know all that much, but also that the breadth of knowledge related to Web Programming is much deeper and more complicated than it seems at first. Now? I feel like I have a working understanding of many of the basics behind the web. I feel like I now have the tools to build myself a beautiful personal website or maybe even build someone else a website... :)

Most Important Thing:
	1) That one client/server picture that Ming has as his background
		> Understanding the HOW behind typing in a URL into the bar and pressing my enter key with the result of a webpage popping up - basically how does my computer communicate with other computers/servers
	2) The importance of web security
		> Assignment 4 was really an eye-opener: not only did I feel like a sneaky hacker, I learned that there are MANY places for security vulnerabilites and that I COULD be a sneaky hacker if someone hasn't covered all the possible vulnerabilities.

Furthering My Knowledge:
	First, I want to explore more ways I can use Javascript - I feel like we used a fair amount of Javascript in this course, but I want more practice with it.
	Second, I want to redo my personal website and thereby practice combining all of the skills that I've learned.

	Thanks for an incredible semester, Ming! I seriously enjoyed learning this stuff and can't wait to do more with it in the future. :D
